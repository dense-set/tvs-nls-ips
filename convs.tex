	Unless stated otherwise, we'll use the following:
	\begin{assmplist}
		\item For vector spaces $V$, $W$ over a common field, $\mathcal L(V, W)$ will denote the set of linear maps $V\to W$ and will be considered a vector space. $\mathcal L(V, V)$ will be considered an associative algebra.
		
		\item For a vector space $V$ and a set $X$, the set $F^X$ will be considered a vector space (over the same field as that of $V$).
		
		
		% Topoloy
		\item $\mathcal C(X, Y)$ will denote the set of continuous functions $X\to Y$ if $X$, $Y$ are topological spaces.
